## Why 90 Funnels?

Targeted funnels outperform generic landing pages. By modeling industries as data and rendering with MDX, we ship bespoke pages at scale without duplicate code.

## Architecture in Brief

- Content: `src/resources/industries.json` + `src/app/industries/pages/*`
- Components: ROI calculator, chat, document generator/uploads
- API: `/api/lead/submit`, HubSpot adapter, PostHog events
- Scripts: content scaffolding via `gen:industries`

## Data Model

Each industry MDX frontmatter defines title, summary, and embeds components. Dynamic CTAs and demos are configured per page or via JSON.

## SEO & Schema

Service and Product JSON-LD are injected on index/detail pages.

## What to Measure

- Funnel step events, CTA impressions and clicks
- Time on page, scroll depth, country/device
- Lead submits â†’ CRM enrichment

## Try It

<FunnelCTA label="Explore Industries" href="/industries" funnel="cta" />
