## Goals

Own your data, ship fast, keep cost low. We log events to JSONL, summarize on-demand, and stream updates via SSE.

## Event Capture

- Client tracker: clicks, moves, UTM, scroll depth, page time
- Server enrichment: IP, UA, optional geolocation

## Visualizations

- Heatmap overlay (admin-only)
- Live counters (SSE) in Admin Analytics
- CSV export endpoints for events, errors, vitals

## Upgrade Path

Run a Prisma migration when ready and migrate JSONL → Postgres with a single script.
