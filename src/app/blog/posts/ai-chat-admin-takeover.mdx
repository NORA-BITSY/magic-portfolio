## Requirements

- Visible widget, low friction
- Admin takeover switch in real time
- Durable logs for QA and sales follow-up

## Design

- In-memory session store + JSONL/JSON rotation
- `/api/chat/stream` SSE for live updates
- Assistant replies pluggable (OpenAI Assistants API adapter seam)

## Hand-off UX

We announce when a teammate joins and stop AI replies. Admin replies are labeled clearly.

## Next Steps

Add vector search for answers and a knowledge toggle per industry page.
