## Problem

Fragmented tooling led to delayed handoffs, manual paperwork, and poor visibility.

## Approach

- Mapped workflows end‑to‑end
- Automated BOL → Billing and status updates
- Embedded exception handling and alerts

## System

- Central operations hub (Next.js + Once UI)
- Agent automations for docs, status, and exceptions
- ROI dashboard and alerts

## Outcomes

- 30–50% back‑office time savings
- 10–15% faster cash cycles
- 2–4x faster exception response
